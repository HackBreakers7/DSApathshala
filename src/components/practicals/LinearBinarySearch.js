          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Search is a process of finding a value in a list of values. In other words,
            searching is the process of locating a given value's position in a list of values.
          </p>

            Linear Search Algorithm (Sequential Search Algorithm)
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Linear search algorithm finds a given element in a list of elements with O(n)
            time complexity, where n is the total number of elements in the list. This
            search process starts by comparing the search element with the first element
            in the list. If both are matched, then the result is "Element found";
            otherwise, the search element is compared with the next element in the list.
            This process is repeated until the search element is compared with the last
            element in the list. If the last element also doesn't match, the result is
            "Element not found in the list."
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Linear search is implemented using the following steps:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside ml-4 text-lg">
            <li>Read the search element from the user.</li>
            <li>Compare the search element with the first element in the list.</li>
            <li>
              If both are matched, display "Given element is found!!!" and terminate the
              function.
            </li>
            <li>
              If both are not matched, compare the search element with the next element
              in the list.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the search element is compared with the last element in the list.</li>
            <li>
              If the last element in the list also doesn't match, display "Element is not
              found!!!" and terminate the function.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Binary Search</h3>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Before searching, the list of items should be sorted in ascending order.
            First, compare the key value with the item in the mid-position of the array.
            If there is a match, return the position immediately. If the value is less
            than the element in the middle location of the array, the required value lies
            in the lower half of the array. 
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4" >If the value is greater than the element in
            the middle location of the array, the required value lies in the upper half
            of the array. Repeat the above procedure on the lower half or upper half of
            the array.
